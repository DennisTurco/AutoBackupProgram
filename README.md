# Auto Backup Program

This is a GUI program that will allow you to perform an automatic backup of folders and subfolders.
you can set an interval of days between each backup, alternatively you can perform manual backups.

## Installation

This Program for correct operation needs to be opened at system startup. so i will walk you through some simple steps:
1) Select the Start  button and scroll to find the app you want to run at startup.
2) Right-click the app, select More, and then select Open file location. This opens the location where the shortcut to the app is saved. If there isn't an option for Open file location, it means the app can't run at startup.
3) With the file location open, press the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then select OK. This opens the Startup folder.

4) Copy and paste the shortcut (not the application "CheckerBackup.exe") to the app (shortcut "CheckerBackup") from the file location to the Startup folder.
