This Program for correct operation needs to be opened at system startup.
so i will walk you through some simple steps:

1)With the file location open, press the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then select OK. This opens the Startup folder.

2)Copy and paste the shortcut (not the application "CheckerBackup.exe") to the app (shortcut "CheckerBackup") from the file location to the Startup folder.
